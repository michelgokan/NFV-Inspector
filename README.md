## Introduction
NFV-Inspector is a systematic VNF profiling and analysis platform, designed for NFV researchers and engineers.
**Documentation, guides and tutorials are under preparation.**


## Getting Started
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Documentation, guides and tutorials are under preparation.**

## Installation
In order to install each service, we have included 'install.sh' files in them. you should simply run `{service}/install.sh` to install. In continue, we documented a step by step guide on how they work in each service.

## Setup your test environment
In order to install OpenStack, I wrote a complete guide in DOCS folder: https://github.com/michelgokan/nfv-inspector/tree/master/docs/openstack-installation-guide

In order to install/setup Kubernetes, I wrote a complete guide here: https://git.cs.kau.se/michkhan/Kubernetes-Cluster-Installation-Guide (will be publically available soon)


## Install NFV-VMS
#### 1- Install MySQL

In order to install/setup Mysql, based on your operating system, you could use the links below, or search it on google to find the best suited for your cases.

###### Ubuntu
* 18.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04 
* 16.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-16-04 
* 14.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-14-04

###### CentOs
* 7: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-centos-7
* 6: https://devops.ionos.com/tutorials/install-mysql-on-centos-6/

  
###### Windows
* http://www.mysqltutorial.org/install-mysql/


After the Installation is done, you have to create table for NFV_VMS. The link below describes how to do common MySQL database administration tasks via command line. 

* https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/managing-mysql-databases-and-users-from-the-command-line

#### 2- Install Kubernetes
In order to install/setup Kubernetes, based on your operating system, you could use the links below, or search it on google to find the best suited for your cases.

###### Ubuntu/CentOS
* https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-install-kubernetes-on-centos-7-ubuntu-18-04-16-04-debian-9.html

If you are about to use NFV-Inspector and your OS is ubuntu, for offline development, prototyping or testing you could just use microK8s. it is available in ubuntu software center and all you need to do is to use the pre installation of docker and kubectl in order to have kubectl environment K8s commands. Also in other operating systems the available light version is called minikube and you could use it instead of installing the whole package of docker and kubernetes.

###### Windows

####  3- Install NFV-VMS 

Based on your Operating system, you can use the following instructions:

###### Ubuntu
  We include an script inside NFV-VMS for the ease of installation process. You should use it at least for the first time configuration.
  ````
