## Introduction
## Getting Started
## Setup your test environment
In order to install OpenStack, I wrote a complete guide in DOCS folder: https://github.com/michelgokan/nfv-inspector/blob/master/DOCS/openstack-installation-guide/README.md
## Install NFV-MON
### Install Elasticsearch and Integrate it with OpenStack
In order to install Elasticsearch I wrote a complete guide in my blog: https://gokan.me/2018/02/18/collectd-elasticsearch-openstack/
### Install NFV-MON Client inside VMs
SSH inside each VM, and run `NFV-MON/nfv-mon-client-install.sh`. It will automatically get installed! To start collectd, use followings command:
